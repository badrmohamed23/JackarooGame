Jackaroo: Single-Player Strategy Game
A modern twist on the classic Middle Eastern board/card game

Custom Ruleset: 15 card types with dual-action choices (e.g., Jack for swaps OR standard moves).

Dynamic Board: Features Home Zones, Base Cells, and randomly shifting trap cells.

Technical Implementation
Languages: Java (core logic)

Files:

Cards.csv (102-card deck configuration)

Custom UI for board/card interactions

OOP Design: Player, Marble, Card, and Board classes with event-driven turns.
